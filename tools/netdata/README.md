# Netdata

## Description

**Netdata** is **distributed, real-time, performance and health monitoring for systems and applications**. It is a
highly-optimized monitoring agent you install on all your systems and containers.

Netdata provides **unparalleled insights**, **in real-time**, of everything happening on the systems it runs (including
web servers, databases, applications), using **highly interactive web dashboards**. It can run autonomously, without any
third-party components, or it can be integrated to existing monitoring toolchains (Prometheus, Graphite, OpenTSDB,
Kafka, Grafana, and more).

Netdata is **fast** and **efficient**, designed to permanently run on all systems (**physical** & **virtual** servers,
**containers**, **IoT** devices), without disrupting their core function.

Netdata is **free, open-source software** and it currently runs on **Linux**, **FreeBSD**, and **MacOS**, along with
other systems derived from them, such as **Kubernetes** and **Docker**.
